  <h3>Let's Dive in</h3>
  <p>
    The American bison once roamed the Great Plains of North America in massive herds, numbering an estimated 30-60 million animals. However, by the late 19th century, the bison population had been decimated to just a few hundred individuals, due to a combination of overhunting, habitat loss, and disease.The American bison is a large, herbivorous mammal with a distinctive humped back and shaggy mane. It is the largest land mammal in North America, with males weighing up to 2,000 pounds and females weighing up to 1,500 pounds. Bison are well-adapted to grazing on the tough grasses and other plants of the Great Plains.Bison play an important role in the ecosystem by helping to maintain the health of the grasslands. Bison grazing helps to control the growth of plants, which prevents them from becoming overgrown and smothering other plants. Bison also help to disperse seeds and aerate the soil.The American bison is currently listed as near threatened on the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species. However, the population has made a significant recovery since the late 19th century, thanks to conservation efforts. There are now an estimated 500,000 bison living in North America, but the vast majority of these animals are located on private ranches and game farms. Only a small percentage of bison live in the wild.The American bison still faces a number of threats, including habitat loss, disease, and competition from livestock. Habitat loss is a major threat, as bison need large areas of grassland to roam and graze. Disease is also a concern, as bison are susceptible to a number of diseases, including brucellosis and tuberculosis. Competition from livestock is another threat, as bison and livestock often compete for the same resources.Conservation efforts are underway to protect the American bison and its habitat. These efforts include protecting and restoring grasslands, reducing the spread of disease, and managing bison populations to ensure their long-term survival.

      <h3>Bone Structure</h3>
      <p>
        The American bison (Bison bison) has a robust bone structure that is adapted to its large size and lifestyle on the Great Plains of North America.The bison's skull is large and heavy, with a thick bony ridge above the eyes to protect the brain during head-butting contests with other bison. The bison's horns are made of keratin, the same material that makes up human hair and nails. They are attached to the skull by a thick bony core.The bison's spine is long and flexible, allowing it to move its head and neck freely. The ribs are broad and strong, providing support for the bison's large chest cavity. The pelvis is also broad and strong, supporting the bison's hindquarters and powerful legs.The bison's legs are short and thick, with large, three-toed hooves. The hooves are well-adapted for walking on soft ground and for running at speeds of up to 35 miles per hour.      </p>
