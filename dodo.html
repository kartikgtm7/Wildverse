  <h3>Let's Dive in</h3>
  <p>The dodo (Raphus cucullatus) was a flightless bird that was endemic to the island of Mauritius in the Indian Ocean. It was about the size of a turkey, with blue-gray plumage, a large head, a hooked bill, and small wings. The dodo was a herbivore, and its diet consisted of fruits, seeds, and leaves.The dodo is believed to have evolved from a flying pigeon ancestor that arrived on Mauritius millions of years ago. Over time, the dodo lost its ability to fly because there were no predators on the island, and it did not need to fly to find food.Humans first arrived on Mauritius in the early 16th century, and the dodo was soon hunted for its meat and eggs. Introduced predators, such as cats, dogs, and pigs, also took their toll on the dodo population. The last dodo was seen in 1662, and the species was declared extinct in 1681.The dodo is a symbol of human-induced extinction. It is a reminder that we need to be careful about how we interact with the environment, and that we need to protect our planet's biodiversity.

    Here are some interesting facts about the dodo:
    
    1-The dodo was a very social bird, and it lived in flocks of up to 30 individuals.
    
    2-The dodo was a very good swimmer.
    
    3-The dodo laid a single egg at a time, and both parents helped to incubate it.
    
    4-The dodo had a lifespan of about 20 years.
    
    5-The dodo is a fascinating bird, and its story is a reminder of the importance of conservation.</p>

      <h3>Bone Structure</h3>
      <p>
        The dodo bone structure was similar to that of other pigeons, but with some notable differences. The dodo's bones were more robust, and its wings were smaller. This is because the dodo was flightless.The dodo's skull was large and round, with a hooked bill. Its beak was used for crushing fruits and seeds. The dodo's neck was short and thick, and its legs were strong and muscular.The dodo's pelvis was wide, which helped to support its weight. Its feet were large and flat, with three toes pointing forward and one toe pointing backward. This helped the dodo to walk and run on the ground.The dodo's bones were hollow, which made them lightweight. This is a common feature of birds, and it helps them to fly. However, the dodo's wings were too small to support its weight, so it could not fly.The dodo's bone structure is a fascinating example of how evolution can adapt an animal to its environment.
