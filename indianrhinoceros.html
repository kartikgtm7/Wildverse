  <h3>Let's Dive in</h3>
  <p>The greater one-horned rhino (or “Indian rhino”) is the largest of the rhino species. Once widespread across the entire northern part of the Indian sub-continent, rhino populations plummeted as they were hunted for sport or killed as agricultural pests. This pushed the species very close to extinction and by the start of the 20th century, around 200 wild greater one-horned rhinos remained. The recovery of the greater one-horned rhino is among the greatest conservation success stories in Asia. Thanks to strict protection and management from Indian and Nepalese wildlife authorities, the greater one-horned rhino was brought back from the brink. Today populations have increased to around 4000 rhinos in northeastern India and the Terai grasslands of Nepal.The greater one-horned rhino is identified by a single black horn about 8-25 inches long and a grey-brown hide with skin folds, which gives it an armor-plated appearance. The species is solitary, except when adult males or rhinos nearing adulthood gather at wallows or to graze. Males have loosely defined home ranges that are not well defended and often overlap. They primarily graze, with a diet consisting almost entirely of grasses as well as leaves, branches of shrubs and trees, fruit, and aquatic plants.</p>

      <h3>Bone Structure</h3>
      <p>
        Its skeleton is adapted to support its massive body weight and protect it from predators.The skull of the one-horned rhinoceros is large and heavy, with a thick bony ridge above the eyes. This ridge helps to protect the rhino's brain from injury during head-butting contests with other rhinos. The rhino's horn is made of keratin, the same material that makes up human hair and nails. It is attached to the skull by a thick bony core.The rhino's spine is long and flexible, allowing it to move its head and neck freely. The ribs are broad and strong, providing support for the rhino's large chest cavity. The pelvis is also broad and strong, supporting the rhino's hindquarters and powerful legs.The rhino's legs are short and thick, with large.
