  <h3>Let's Dive in</h3>
  <p>The Gobi bear (Ursus arctos gobiensis) is a subspecies of brown bears that exist only in the Gobi desert of Mongolia. There are less than 40 mature adults remaining in the wild, and no Gobi bears are held in captivity. This bear is a rugged and persistent scavenger who manages to live in a region that averages less than four inches of rainfall per year.Habitat loss due to mining in the area and uncontrolled grazing of other animals devastated the Mongolian grasslands of ages past, and this has resulted in a significant impact on all species living in the area. Furthermore, a 14-year drought in which less than two inches of rain fell annually further depleted the scarce vegetation that the Gobi bear lives on.Conservation efforts are in place such as designating the bears last three habitats one large national preserve, and researchers have tagged 20 adults to monitor the population. Gobi bears are solitary animals, and they only come together to mate. Females give birth to two or three cubs in the spring, and the cubs stay with their mother for two years. Gobi bears reach sexual maturity at around five years old, and they can live for up to 30 years in the wild.Gobi bears are an important part of the Gobi Desert ecosystem. They help to control populations of rodents and other small animals, and they also disperse seeds and help to pollinate plants. Gobi bears are also a popular tourist attraction, and they play an important role in the local economy.</p>

      <h3>Bone Structure</h3>
      <p>
        The gorilla skeleton is similar to the human skeleton, but with some key differences. Gorillas have a more robust skeleton, with denser bones and larger muscle attachments. This is because gorillas are much stronger than humans, and their bones need to be able to support their weight and muscle mass. One of the most noticeable features of the gorilla skeleton is the large sagittal crest on the top of the skull. This crest supports the powerful temporal muscles, which are used for chewing. Gorillas also have a large nuchal crest at the back of the skull, which supports the neck muscles.Gorillas have long arms and short legs. Their arms are longer than their legs relative to their body size than in any other primate.
