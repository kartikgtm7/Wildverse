  <h3>Let's Dive in</h3>
  <p>The Cross River gorilla (Gorilla gorilla diehli) is an incredibly rare and endangered primate species native to the dense forests of Nigeria and Cameroon in West Africa. With an estimated population of fewer than 300 individuals, it is one of the most critically endangered gorilla subspecies. Cross River gorillas are distinguished by their distinct physical features, including a prominent bony crest on the top of their skulls and auburn-colored fur. They are primarily herbivorous, feeding on a diet of leaves, fruits, and occasionally insects.Their critical endangerment is largely due to habitat loss through deforestation, human encroachment, and poaching. Conservation efforts aim to protect their remaining habitats, raise awareness about the species, and combat illegal hunting. Collaborative initiatives between local communities, governments, and conservation organizations seek to ensure the survival of these remarkable and rare gorillas and preserve the biodiversity of their forest ecosystems. Their pelvis is wide and robust, providing support for their large abdomen and internal organs while offering stability during quadrupedal movement. Long bones are thick and sturdy, essential for bearing their massive body weight. Their hands and feet have long, flexible digits with opposable thumbs and big toes, facilitating grasping branches and precision gripping. This bone structure enables gorillas to thrive in their forested habitats, expertly navigating both tree canopies and forest floors.</p>

      <h3>Bone Structure</h3>
      <p>
        The bone structure of gorillas is a testament to their versatile lifestyle. Their large skulls feature prominent brow ridges and cranial crests, especially in adult males, providing anchorage for powerful jaw muscles, which are necessary for processing their tough, vegetation-based diet. The vertebral column is both long and flexible, adapted for both quadrupedal and occasional bipedal locomotion. With longer arms than legs, gorillas can swing through trees and knuckle-walk on the ground. Their pelvis is wide and robust, providing support for their large abdomen and internal organs while offering stability during quadrupedal movement. Long bones are thick and sturdy, essential for bearing their massive body weight. Their hands and feet have long, flexible digits with opposable thumbs and big toes, facilitating grasping branches and precision gripping.
