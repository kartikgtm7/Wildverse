  <h3>Let's Dive in</h3>
  <p>Mammoths, the prehistoric giants that once roamed the Earth, emerged approximately 5 million years ago during the Pleistocene epoch, spanning from about 2.6 million to 11,700 years ago. These colossal, long-haired relatives of modern elephants displayed incredible adaptability, thriving in environments ranging from the icy tundras of North America and Eurasia to the temperate grasslands of southern continents.Tragically, mammoths faced extinction due to a combination of climate change and the relentless hunting by early humans, marking the end of an era. Recent scientific advancements, such as the discovery of well-preserved mammoth carcasses in Siberian permafrost, have reignited fascination with these magnificent creatures. Today, scientists are actively exploring the potential of de-extinction through genetic engineering, drawing from preserved mammoth DNA.Although mammoths remain extinct in the present day, ongoing research and debates continue to deepen our understanding of their historical significance and potential future role. Notably, the revival of mammoths holds significant ecological promise, as they could help combat climate change by promoting grassland growth and preventing permafrost thaw. Thus, mammoths, once ancient titans, may yet contribute to the unfolding narrative of our modern world.</p>

      <h3>Bone Structure</h3>
      <p>
        Mammoths had a robust bone structure adapted for their massive size, featuring dense and sturdy bones, long tusks, large skulls with trunks, specialized vertebrae, short limbs for cold climates, and broad, flat feet. These adaptations allowed them to thrive in ice age environments. However, despite their structural advantages, mammoths went extinct due to environmental changes and human hunting.
