  <h3>Let's Dive in</h3>
  <p>The Irish elk (Megaloceros giganteus), also called the giant deer, was an extinct species of deer that lived during the Pleistocene epoch, from about 2.6 million to 11,700 years ago. It was one of the largest deer that ever lived, standing up to 2.1 meters (6 feet 11 inches) tall at the shoulders and weighing up to 700 kilograms (1,540 pounds). The Irish elk was also known for its massive antlers, which could span up to 3.65 meters (12 feet) from tip to tip and weigh up to 40 kilograms (88 pounds).The Irish elk was a herbivore, and its diet consisted of grasses, leaves, and other plants. It is believed to have lived in open woodlands and grasslands. The Irish elk was likely a social animal, and it may have lived in herds.The Irish elk became extinct at the end of the Pleistocene epoch. The reasons for its extinction are not fully understood, but it is thought to have been a combination of factors, including climate change, habitat loss, and hunting by humans.

    Here is a more detailed description of the Irish elk's physical features:
    
    1-Large body size, up to 2.1 meters (6 feet 11 inches) tall at the shoulders and 700 kilograms (1,540 pounds) in weight.
    
    2-Long, thick neck.
    
    3-The Irish elk was a truly impressive creature, and its fossils continue to fascinate scientists and the public alike.
    
    4-Large, flat feet.
    
    5-Massive antlers, spanning up to 3.65 meters (12 feet) from tip to tip and weighing up to 40 kilograms (88 pounds).</p>

      <h3>Bone Structure</h3>
      <p>
        The Irish elk (Megaloceros giganteus) had a robust bone structure, adapted to its large size and heavy antlers. Its skull was large and rounded, with a broad forehead and a short nasal bone. The antlers were attached to the skull by large pedicles, and they were composed of a series of bony segments that were connected by cartilage.The Irish elk's neck was long and thick, and its spine was curved to support the weight of its head and antlers. Its legs were long and powerful, with large hooves. The pelvis was wide to support the weight of the hindquarters, and the tail was long and thin.The Irish elk's bones were hollow, which made them lightweight but also strong. This was important for an animal of its size, which needed to be able to move quickly and avoid predators.
