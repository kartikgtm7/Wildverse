  <h3>Let's Dive in</h3>
  <p>The Philippine crocodile (Crocodylus mindorensis) is a small to medium-sized freshwater crocodile that is endemic to the Philippines. It is one of the most endangered crocodilians in the world, with an estimated population of only 92-137 individuals remaining in the wild.The Philippine crocodile is a relatively small species, reaching breeding maturity at 1.5 meters (4.9 feet) in length. Males can grow up to 3 meters (9.8 feet) long, but females are typically smaller. Philippine crocodiles have a broad snout and thick bony plates on their back. They are brown in color with black markings.Philippine crocodiles are found in freshwater rivers, ponds, and marshes. They are ambush predators, and their diet consists of fish, aquatic invertebrates, small mammals, other reptiles, and some birds. Philippine crocodiles are shy animals and tend to avoid humans. However, they can be dangerous if they feel threatened.The Philippine crocodile is threatened by a number of factors, including habitat loss, poaching, and conflict with humans. Habitat loss is the most serious threat, as Philippine crocodiles have lost over 90% of their historic habitat. Poaching is also a major problem, as crocodile meat and skins are valuable commodities. Additionally, Philippine crocodiles are sometimes killed by humans in retaliation for livestock attacks.Conservation efforts are underway to protect the Philippine crocodile. Several protected areas have been established to protect crocodile habitat, and captive breeding programs are being used to increase the population. However, much more needs to be done to save the Philippine crocodile from extinction.</p>

      <h3>Bone Structure</h3>
      <p>
        The Philippine crocodile (Crocodylus mindorensis) has a robust skeleton that is adapted to its semi-aquatic lifestyle. The skull is broad and flat, with a long snout and powerful jaws. The teeth are sharp and conical, and they are used to catch and tear prey. The vertebral column is long and flexible, allowing the crocodile to swim and move easily in the water. The ribs are broad and strong, and they protect the internal organs from injury. The limbs are short and powerful, and they are used to propel the crocodile through the water and to support its weight on land.The skull of the Philippine crocodile is one of the most distinctive features of its bone structure. The broad snout and powerful jaws allow the crocodile to catch and subdue large prey. The teeth are sharp and conical.
