  <h3>Let's Dive in</h3>
  <p>The Bengal tiger, scientifically known as Panthera tigris tigris, is an iconic and majestic big cat. They are the largest of the tiger subspecies, reaching lengths of 10 to 12 feet and weighing between 400 to 600 pounds for males and 220 to 350 pounds for females. With their bright orange coat and distinctive black stripes, each Bengal tiger has a unique stripe pattern. Some rare white variants exist due to genetic mutations.These magnificent creatures primarily inhabit the Indian subcontinent, from India to Bangladesh, Bhutan, and Nepal. They occupy diverse ecosystems, including dense forests, grasslands, and mangrove swamps. Bengal tigers are solitary and nocturnal, active at night. They mark territories with scent markings and vocalizations.As carnivores, they prey on large ungulates and are skilled hunters, known for their stealth and agility. Sadly, Bengal tigers are endangered due to habitat loss and poaching for traditional Chinese medicine. Conservation efforts, including protected reserves and anti-poaching measures, are in place.Culturally, the Bengal tiger holds great significance as India's national animal and appears in various mythologies and folklore. These magnificent creatures symbolize strength, power, and majesty, making them emblematic of wildlife conservation and the need to protect the Indian subcontinent's natural habitats. Despite the challenges, they remain a testament to the importance of preserving biodiversity.</p>

      <h3>Bone Structure</h3>
      <p>
        The Bengal tiger's bone structure is designed for a carnivorous, predatory lifestyle. They have a powerful skull with sharp, elongated canines for biting. Their spine is flexible, aiding in stealthy stalking and pouncing. Strong, muscular limbs support quick movements, with retractable claws for gripping prey. Large, padded paws help with shock absorption and silent movement. The ribcage protects vital organs, and the pelvis supports hind limb power for leaping. A long, muscular tail aids in balance and communication. These adaptations make the Bengal tiger a highly efficient and effective predator in its natural habitat.
