  <h3>Let's Dive in</h3>
  <p>The vaquita (Phocoena sinus) is the smallest and most endangered marine mammal in the world. It is a porpoise that is found only in the Gulf of California, Mexico. Vaquitas are about 5 feet long and weigh about 100 pounds. They have dark gray skin and a white patch on their belly. Vaquitas are shy and elusive animals, and they are rarely seen by humans.Vaquitas are an important part of the Gulf of California ecosystem. They eat small fish, squid, and shrimp. Vaquitas are also a food source for other marine animals, such as sharks and dolphins. Illegal fishing: Vaquitas are often caught in fishing nets that are set for other fish, such as shrimp and totoaba. Totoaba is a large fish that is prized for its bladder, which is used in traditional Chinese medicine. Habitat loss: Vaquitas live in a very small area of the Gulf of California. Their habitat is being degraded by pollution and overfishing. Climate change: Climate change is causing the Gulf of California to become warmer and saltier. This is making it harder for vaquitas to survive. Conservation efforts are underway to protect the vaquita. The Mexican government has banned fishing in the vaquita's habitat, and there are a number of organizations working to reduce pollution and protect the vaquita's habitat. However, the vaquita remains in critical danger of extinction. Here are some additional facts about the vaquita:It is the only marine mammal that is found only in Mexico,also It is one of the most endangered marine mammals in the world,It is a shy and elusive animal, and it is rarely seen by humans,It is an important part of the Gulf of California ecosystem,It is threatened by illegal fishing, habitat loss, and climate change and the vaquita is a unique and important animal. It is important to do everything we can to protect this endangered species.</p>

      <h3>Bone Structure</h3>
      <p>
        The vaquita (Phocoena sinus) has a streamlined skeleton that is adapted to its aquatic lifestyle. The skull is small and rounded, with a long snout and powerful jaws. The teeth are sharp and conical, and they are used to catch and tear prey. The vertebral column is long and flexible, allowing the vaquita to swim and move easily in the water. The ribs are broad and strong, and they protect the internal organs from injury. The limbs are short and paddle-shaped, and they are used to propel the vaquita through the water. The vaquita's bone structure is a marvel of adaptation. It allows the vaquita to swim quickly and efficiently, and to catch and eat prey. The vaquita's small size and streamlined body also help it to avoid predators.
